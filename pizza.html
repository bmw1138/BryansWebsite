        <p class="welcome">Welcome to my recipe blog!</p>
        <p>As you may have noticed, I've decided to buck the usual recipe blog tradition and start with recipes first
          and blog second. That way you don't have to scroll through all my nonsense to get to what you really want.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Christmas a few years ago, my wife got me an Ooni Wood-Fired Pizza Oven. I love pizza and this was a
          wonderful gift. The learning curve was a bit steep at first, making pizzas that were simultaneously burnt and
          raw inside, but I eventually got the hang of it.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1567.jpg" alt="Ooni Pizza Oven" class="blog">
        <p>
          To make the dough, I use our bread maker. It’s less messy and does a great job of kneading and rising the
          dough.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1562.jpg" alt="Raw ingredients in bread maker" class="blog">
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1563.jpg" alt="Finished dough in bread maker" class="blog">
        <p>
          Once it's done, I separate the dough out into smaller pieces to make individual sized pizzas using a dough
          knife.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1564.jpg" alt="Dough ball" class="blog">
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1565.jpg" alt="six dough balls and dough knife" class="blog">
        <p>
          To flatten to dough, I take the ball and turn it like a steering wheel, slowly expanding it into a circle
          (though they often end up more like ovals). I stop when I can see light through the middle. Having a thin
          middle crust helps it cook more evenly.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1566.jpg" alt="Flattened pizza dough" class="blog">
        <p>
          It's important when adding toppings, not to overload the pizzas otherwise the dough won't bake thoroughly in
          the middle, and you'll end up with burnt and raw pizza.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1574.jpg" alt="Pizza dough with toppings" class="blog">
        <p>
          Some important tools to have when cooking pizzas in the Ooni oven are a peel to move the pizzas in and out
          (along with a metal spatula to help turn them) and a laser temperature sensor. This is especially helpful in
          knowing when to put the pizzas into the oven. Too low, and they don't cook right (don't worry about getting it
          too hot - high temps are good).
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1569.jpg" alt="Pizza peel" class="blog">
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1570.jpg" alt="Laser thermometer" class="blog">
        <p>
          The Ooni uses wood pellets (I have a gas attachment but have not used it yet). To start, fill the basket part
          way and use a fire starter to get them burning.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1568.jpg" alt="basket with fire starter and pellets" class="blog">
        <p>
          Once it's burning, keep the basket filled to the top with pellets otherwise the temperature can drop quickly
          inside.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1576.jpg" alt="basket with fire starter and pellets" class="blog">
        <p>
          You'll know when the fire is really going when you see what I call “Pope smoke,” that is, a light white smoke
          coming out of the chimney.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1572.jpg" alt="basket with fire starter and pellets" class="blog">
        <p>
          Check the temperature. It's important the stone inside be about 750° F (400° C). The flames should fill the
          back
          of the oven. Put your pizza in the oven and turn it about every 10 to 15 seconds so it cooks evenly. You only
          need about 60 seconds to cook it through.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/pizza/IMG_1575.jpg" alt="Pizza cooking in the oven" class="blog">
        <p>
          The final step is to enjoy your creation!
        </p>

        <p>Eventually, I plan to experiment with dessert pizza (which may require <a
